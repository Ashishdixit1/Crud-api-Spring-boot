Cloud Vendor CRUD API with JPA and MySQL

This repository contains a Cloud Vendor CRUD API developed using Spring Boot, JPA (Java Persistence API), and MySQL as the database. The API provides endpoints to manage cloud vendors, allowing users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on cloud vendor data.

Features:
- Create: Add new cloud vendors to the system with relevant details such as name, services offered, and contact information.
- Read: Retrieve a list of all registered cloud vendors or fetch details for a specific vendor based on their unique identifier.
- Update: Modify existing vendor information, such as service offerings or contact details.
- Delete: Remove cloud vendors from the system when they are no longer relevant.

Technology Stack:
- Spring Boot: Provides the framework for building robust and scalable Java applications.
- JPA (Java Persistence API): Facilitates the mapping of Java objects to relational database tables, allowing seamless interaction with the MySQL database.
- MySQL: The chosen database management system for storing cloud vendor information.

How to Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the MySQL database connection settings in the application.properties file.
3. Build and run the application using Maven or your preferred IDE.
4. Access the API endpoints using a REST client like Postman.
